    Mango Hill State School opened in January 2012 to service the growing Mango Hill community.  

Our five core values are:

<b>Excellence</b> - celebrating success in academic, sporting and cultural pursuits

<b>Respect</b> - treating self and others with kindness, tolerance, care and compassion

<b>Innovation</b> - finding clever, creative ways of working

<b>Teamwork</b> - developing partnerships, co-operation and collaboration for success

<b>Commitment</b> - striving to achieve through persistence and determination.

These values are used to guide decision-making for the school and are explicitly taught to children through the code of school behaviour.

Our master planned school is an engaging learning community with state of the art technology and facilities, quality staff and outstanding resources. We are focussed on teaching and learning to assist each child to reach their potential.

As an Independent Public School, all staff have been selected by the Principal based on their expertise and experience. We are proud of our fantastic teachers and support staff.

Mango Hill SS is a great school!

High standards for literacy and numeracy;
Creating strong partnerships with families and the community; and 
Innovative teaching by engaging technology for the 21st century.

        At Mango Hill State School our motto is growing, learning, achieving together, as this reflects our children growing in size, ability and confidence. It also reflects the partnerships and cooperation we utilise working together to assist each child to achieve their learning potential.

Our five values are as follows:

Respect- treating self and others with kindness, tolerance, care and compassion
Excellence- celebrating success in academic, sporting and cultural pursuits
Innovation- finding clever, creative ways of learning and working
Teamwork- developing partnerships, cooperation and collaboration for success
Commitment- striving to achieve through persistence and determination.
These values will underpin all decisions at Mango Hill and will be the foundation for our way of working.

When teaching the code of school behaviour we will use the following:

Care for self
Care for others
Care for learning
Care for our school environment.
We will explicitly teach a range of positive behaviours and make clear school expectations. <a href = "https://mangohillss.eq.edu.au/Documents/Student%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20(PDF%202MB).pdf" target="_blank" >Student Code of Conduct (PDF 2MB)</a> and <a href = "https://mangohillss.eq.edu.au/SupportAndResources/FormsAndDocuments/Documents/Policies/mango-hill-state-school-dress-code-2021.pdf" target="_blank" >School dress code (PDF, 285KB)</a> outline the school's approach to ensuring all students, staff and members of our community can attend Mango Hill State School and be treated with respect and consideration.
